# Aardvark's flanking

This provides an alternative to the official flanking rules for D&D 5e.

> A creature is flanked if it is within melee reach of two or more opponents
> wielding melee weapons, and at least two of those opponents are on opposite
> sides of the creature. An opponent can't flank a creature it can't see, and
> it can't flank while it is incapacitated. Melee attacks against a flanked
> creature gain a +1 bonus for each opponent flanking it, up to a maximum of +4.

The maximum bonus is configurable in settings.

Flanking takes into account creature size and elevation.
